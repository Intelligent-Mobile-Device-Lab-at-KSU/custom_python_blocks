# gnu_radio_cutsom_python_files
This respository is a collection of python files used in GNURadio for various projects.

# Using these files  
In the lib folder there are various projects. each of which have a .grc file and a python file. The .grc file contains the project that was made for the custom Python block. The Python file is the actual Python block. To use the Python block follow these steps:  
1.) Create a new GNU Radio Companion Project  
2.) Add a python block (not a module)  
3.) Simply copy and paste the code into the python block and hit save  

When returning to GNU Radio Companion you will see the block updated and have any variables from these files. To see more information on writing custom python blocks, go to [this](https://wiki.gnuradio.org/index.php/Guided_Tutorial_GNU_Radio_in_Python#3.2.3._Modifying_the_Python_Block_File) webpage.  

All signals use complex numbers in this project.
